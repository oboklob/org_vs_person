# Corpus Configuration Example
# 
# This file demonstrates how to configure multiple corpus sources for the name classifier.
# Copy this file to 'corpus_config.yaml' and adjust paths and settings as needed.
#
# Each source can have different formats, compression, and column mappings.
# The prepare_data.py script will load all sources and merge them before deduplication.

sources:
  # Example 1: Paranames dataset (TSV with gzip compression)
  - name: "paranames"
    path: "corpus/paranames.tsv.gz"
    format: "tsv"
    compression: "gzip"
    columns:
      name: "label"              # Column containing the name/label
      classification: "type"     # Column containing the classification (ORG/PER)
    filters:
      type: ["ORG", "PER"]       # Only keep these classification types
  
  # Example 2: Company register (CSV with fixed classification)
  # Use this when all entries in the file have the same classification
  - name: "nexus_export"
    path: "corpus/organization_names.csv.gz"
    format: "csv"
    compression: "gzip"
    columns:
      name: "name"  # Column containing organization names
      classification: null       # No classification column in this file
    fixed_classification: "ORG"  # Apply ORG classification to all rows
  
# Configuration Schema:
# ====================
# sources: List of corpus sources to load
#
# Each source has:
#   name: (string) Identifier for the source (used in logging)
#   path: (string) Path to the corpus file (relative to project root or absolute)
#   format: (string) File format - "tsv" or "csv"
#   compression: (string|null) Compression type - "gzip" or null for uncompressed
#   columns:
#     name: (string) Column name containing the names/labels
#     classification: (string|null) Column name containing classifications, or null if using fixed_classification
#   fixed_classification: (string, optional) Fixed classification to apply to all rows (ORG or PER)
#                         Only used when columns.classification is null
#   filters: (dict, optional) Filters to apply after loading
#     type: (list) List of classification types to keep (e.g., ["ORG", "PER"])
